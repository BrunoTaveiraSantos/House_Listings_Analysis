# House_Listings_Analysis

The Real Estate Data Analysis project is an in-depth exploration of the housing market using web scraping techniques to collect data from various real estate agency websites. The project encompasses data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to gain valuable insights into the real estate market trends and factors affecting property prices. This repository showcases the process and findings of the project.

## Data Collection:
The project involved leveraging the Selenium web scraping library to extract real estate data from multiple real estate agency websites. By automating the web scraping process, a significant amount of data was collected, including property details (such as location, size, amenities), listing prices, and other relevant information. The data was retrieved systematically, ensuring a comprehensive representation of the market.

## Data Cleaning:
Once the raw data was collected, an extensive data cleaning process was conducted to ensure data quality and consistency. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and addressing outliers. By applying appropriate data cleaning techniques, the dataset was prepared for further analysis, reducing the risk of skewed or inaccurate insights.

## Data Analysis:
The cleaned dataset was subjected to a series of exploratory data analysis techniques to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends within the real estate market. Descriptive statistics, data visualization, and statistical modeling techniques were employed to derive meaningful insights. Key factors affecting property prices, such as location, property size, amenities, and market demand, were analyzed to understand their impact on housing prices.
